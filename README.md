## Domain

Dog breed classification is really challenging due to the minimal inter-class variations.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model can be used for this task.
Due to the existence of a huge variety of species and organisms, research on
technology to classify them is crucial. Hsu, David from Stanford University published
a paper about using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify dog breeds.

## Project Overview

The aim of the project is to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied
images. A CNN will be used to predict the breed of a dog from the input image. Given
an image of a dog, the model will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If
supplied an image of a human, it will identify the resembling dog breed.
